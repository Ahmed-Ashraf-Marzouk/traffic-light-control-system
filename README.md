# traffic-light-tivaC
Traffic light implementation using tivaware on tivac 123gh6pm board. 


## Introduction

During this course, you studied microcontroller architecture along with basic embedded C programming. You have addressed project 
building process, digital I/O applied on Arm Cortex M4 TivaC. Group of course assignments delivered by individuals are considered as the 
first corner stone in this project. It is intended to assess all these engineering design aspects along with other skills.

## Objectives

The goal of this project is to design a traffic light control system. The system contains simply two traffic lights. One allows cars to move from 
north to south, and the other one allows cars to move from east to west. Beside each traffic there is also a pedestrian traffic light. The 
pedestrian has to press on a button to have his light green to cross the street safely.
By the end of this project you have to master the following:
1. Timers: You will be using at least two timers to configure the span of the traffic lights.
2. GPIO: You will be using LEDs as outputs, and push buttons as input.
3. Interrupts: You will use interrupts also in this project for the push buttons and timers
